## In Question 1 
I  have calculated the availability and down time percentage by a function from rows that have NA message codes and the availability is very good and I tried to see if the manufacturer affects on down time but it doesnâ€™t have large effect since machines from NCR makes large withdraw processes and it also have large downtimes so it is proportional.
## In Question 2 
I have insight to do Cash replenishment or regular maintenance activities at hours from 1 to 4 because it has the least withdraw processes.
## In Question 3 
I located the top 10 locations used by customers so we need to locate our ATMs there to ensure maximum coverage.
